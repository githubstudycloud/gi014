# 📓 Obsidian Work Management System

Welcome to your structured work note system. This setup is designed to handle tasks that span multiple weeks while keeping your daily and monthly records clean.

## 📂 Directory Guide

- **`Weekly/`**: Your primary workspace. Use the `Weekly_Template` every Monday.
- **`Monthly/`**: For high-level planning and month-end reviews.
- **`Tasks/`**: **CRITICAL**. For any task that takes more than a week, create a dedicated note here. Link to it from your Weekly notes.
- **`Projects/`**: For large-scale projects that contain multiple tasks.
- **`Templates/`**: Standardized formats for consistency.

## 🛠️ How to Handle Multi-Week Tasks

1. **Create a Task Note**: When a task starts, create a new note in `Tasks/` using the `Task_Template`.
2. **Link in Weekly Note**: In your `Weekly/` note, under the "Active Tasks" section, link to the task: `[[Task Name]]`.
3. **Update Status**: Update the progress *inside* the task note. This way, you don't have to copy-paste progress every week.
4. **Finalize**: Once finished, move the task note to `Archive/` or mark it as completed.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Set your Obsidian Template folder to `Obsidian_Work_Management/Templates`.
2. Install the **Periodic Notes** and **Calendar** plugins for the best experience.
3. Start your first Weekly note!
